# K2 Sentinel

A standalone Factorio 2.0 MOD that brings the Sentinel entity from [Krastorio2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2) to vanilla gameplay.

## Features

- **Sentinel** — a 1x1 compact radar that monitors 1 nearby chunk with low power consumption
- **Technology tree restructuring** — lamp → sentinel → radar progression; radar is pushed back to the chemical science pack era
- **Radar enhancement** — vanilla radar is buffed at the cost of higher power consumption, creating a clear role separation from the sentinel
- **Achievement** — "Big brother is watching you" for building 100 sentinels

## Technology Tree

 └─ sentinel (automation science pack)

## Compatibility
